# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Guide

## Introduction

**Neural Network**: An artificial intelligence model inspired by human neurons and brain structure. It uses interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) to process information and make predictions.

## Types of Neural Networks

### 1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Network Architecture

### Feedforward Neural Network

#### Forward Propagation

- Process where input data flows through network layers
- Each layer processes and passes data to the next layer
- Final layer produces the result/prediction

#### Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)

- **When Used**: When model accuracy is insufficient
- **Process**:
  - Updates weight and bias values
  - Works backward from output to input layers
  - Minimizes loss function
  - Increases overall accuracy

### Layer Structure

#### 1. Input Layer

- **Function**: Receives raw data
- **Characteristics**: Number of neurons equals input features

#### 2. Hidden Layer(s)

- **Function**: Processes and transforms data
- **Characteristics**: Can have multiple hidden layers (deep learning)

#### 3. Output Layer

- **Function**: Produces final results/predictions
- **Characteristics**: Number of neurons depends on problem type

## Training Process

### Loss Functions

- **Definition**: Measure difference between predicted and actual target values
- **Purpose**: Quantify model performance
- **Goal**: Minimize loss to improve accuracy

### Gradient Descent

- **Type**: Optimization algorithm
- **Purpose**: Minimize loss function
- **Process**:
  - Calculates gradients (derivatives)
  - Updates weights and biases
  - Iteratively improves model performance

## Hardware Requirements

- **GPU Acceleration**: Highly recommended for:
  - Faster training times
  - Handling large datasets
  - Complex model architectures
  - Real-time inference

# Activation Functions - Forward Propagation

## 1. Sigmoid

- **Use:** Output layer, binary classification (0/1)
- **Formula:**
  \[
  \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \quad \text{where } z = (\text{input} \times \text{weight} + \text{bias})
  \]
- **Range:** 0 to 1
- **Curve:** S-shaped
- **Notes:** Related to logistic regression; good for yes/no decisions

## 2. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)

- **Use:** Hidden layers
- **Formula:**
  \[
  \tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
  \]
- **Range:** -1 to +1
- **Pros:** Zero-centered output
- **Cons:** Vanishing gradient problem
- **Complexity:** Higher than ReLU
- **Notes:** Common in deep networks; careful with deep layers

---

## 3. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)

- **Use:** Hidden layers, input layers
- **Formula:**
  \[
  \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
  \]
- **Range:** 0 to ∞
- **Pros:** Computationally simple
- **Cons:** Dead neuron problem (if x ≤ 0, neuron may stop learning)
- **Variants:**
  - **Leaky ReLU:** allows small gradient when x < 0
  - **Parametric ReLU:** slope learned during training
  - **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**

---

## 4. Softmax

- **Use:** Output layer, multi-class classification
- **Formula:**
  \[
  \text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}
  \]
- **Range:** 0 to 1 (sum of outputs = 1)
- **Notes:** Generalization of sigmoid for multiple classes
