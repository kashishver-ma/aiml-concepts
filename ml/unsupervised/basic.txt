unsupervised

unlabelled dataset

solve problem of - cluster , association, dimeansion position

cluster-  3 type kmems and kmens++ , dbscan,hierarnchy cluster
dimenison position- PCa
association-mba, aprovi

1. cluster:

group of similar class 


kmens and kmens++ : used to solve clustering problem

k= no. of clusters

one cluster has centroid-center position
k=1

3 cluster 3 centroid 
k=3


say eg: 
 x-y plane

 red cluster (a)
 blue cluster (b)
 brown cluster (c) 

 distance calculation : euclediean method  sqrt. (x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2
 4 formule for distance 
 google map use which method to cal distance ?

 As data added :  shape of cluster changes 

 knen : k nearest neighbours 

 drawback of kmens:  if point come out of cluster(like outliers)

 how will u define value of k ??
 how many cluster?

 WCSS - within cluster sum of square

1. intracluster distance = from centeroid to circum of cluster

2. inter cluster distance = from cetroid of oe cluster to cir of other cluster (Datapoint)

inhertia  = wcss= sigma  wcss
wcss= (c,x)^2


ELBOW METHOD:

wcss vs k

as wcss increase k dec inversly propositional

Elbow point =  point from where k value remia constant even if u change wcss


UNSUPERVISED MODEL DURATION TECHNIQUE : 

# DUMM INDEX AND SILHONTE SCORE

dumm index  = increase cluster / decrease intra cluster dis will lead to higher accuracy

silhonte score : 

ss=
if ss=1 model well
ss=-1 wronf
ss=0 okok

intercluster distance = sepration distance in ss (b) 
a =intra cluster dis

formuala= (b-a)/ma(a,b)

if a==b overall 0
if a> b -1 
if b>a = 1

kmens++ :





cluster type 2 : DBSCAN

DESNITY based spatial clustering of app with noise
