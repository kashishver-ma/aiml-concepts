##interview imp: 


hyperperatery- by changing this we can shift accuracy
how we can get to know whihc value will be best for accuracy

hyperparameter tuning is used to find this value - 5types main 2 
grid search cv :
 drawback- do much calculation cpu power

random search cv: automatically chose one and give best parater value
